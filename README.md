# bbMenuPolish Read Me

This is still in early development so I'm sure there are bugs and I'm sure the code could be cleaned up, but it's a good start.

###To Use
1. Download the files.
2. Put them into a `bbMenuPolish` folder if they aren't already.
3. Put the folder into your WordPress plugin directory.
4. Activate the plugin.

That's it. There are no options yet.
